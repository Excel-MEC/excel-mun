                <strong>Dear Leaders of Tomorrow,</strong>
                <p>
                The world is an interesting confluence of languages, cultures, perspectives and opinions. History  has witnessed the rise and fall of great nations and its people, the reign of progressive civilizations and the barbaric acts or despotic leaders. On the one hand, people all over the world continue to erect walls while on the other, technology has brought the world closer. In an age where alliances are fluid and extremism finds footing, it is upto the future leaders of the world to mould the course of mankind.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Govt. Model Engineering College Model United Nations (MECMUN) aims to groom the leaders of tomorrow and equip them with the skill and knowledge to take over the reigns of the world, while at the same time maintaining professionalism and decorum mandated by society. MUN is the right platform for energetic and proficient delegates to speak out their ambitions for the future and empower them to take responsibility in building new mindsets from concealed perspectives. MECMUN aspires to elucidate the might of cooperation, the art of diplomacy and the need for artistry in substantial inquisition, oratory, debate and negotiation.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is with great honour that we invite you to be a part of the inaugural conclave of MECMUN - The Model United Nations hosted by the students of Govt. Model Engineering College, Kochi, on <strong>29th and 30th of August, 2017, at Gokulam Park convention center, Kochi.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                While keeping with the conventional pattern of MUNs, MECMUN will infuse new schemes to enhance the experience and make the session as interactive and open minded as possible. The time spent participating in this high dynamic event will leave delegates inspired and in turn, empower them to take the necessary steps to tackle problems in society. The experience will guide you to voice your thoughts on a better tomorrow  beyond the confines of the committee room, and challenge you to think critically about the policies to consider while taking decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                Irrespective of whether you are an experienced MUN delegate or a first time participant, we request your participation in the session. Fellow participants will leave you intrigued with their in depth thoughts about the issue in discussion, and certainly will have a lot to learn from at the end of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                Feel free to contact us for any queries related to participating in the session. We look forward to seeing you at the conclave.
                </p>
                <strong>Sincerely,</strong><br>

                    <hr>
                    <p>North Korea is well on its way to becoming a nuclear-armed state with the Kim Jong-un regime impervious to coercion, sanctions or incentives. Any attempt by the NATO to conduct a disarming strike against North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and missile forces would be extremely risky, possibly initiating a full-scale war with Pyongyang. The cornerstone of our collective policy should remain unchanged; to do otherwise would put the entire fabric of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty at risk and accede to a nuclear weapons capability in the hands of what may be the world’s single most brutal regime. But we also need to recognize reality: North Korea continues to test nuclear weapons—no other country has done so this century. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>The issue of of South China Sea, has been resurfacing consistently for the past ten years. Nations have made efforts to gain control over it and its resources, which has often lead to conflict. The region of South East Asia, has been the most disputed, oceanic regions over the last few decades.The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines three distinct areas - territorial waters, exclusive economic zones, and international waters. Territorial waters are those under government sovereign control and legally recognized as twelve nautical miles from the low water mark of a coastal state, but the issue of common SEZs, has created tensions in many regions around the globe. The SPECPOL will meet this session, to analyze these conflicts and deliberate on these issue for the betterment of the global community.</p>

                    <h5>UNSC</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Human Intervention refers to a form of intervention in a state by another, by virtue of large scale violation of internationally recognised Human Rights. Interventions may vary from military action to sanctions or aid. The matter of humanitarian intervention has remained an engrossing foreign policy issue, especially since NATO&#39;s intervention in Kosovo in 1999. &#39;Responsibility to Protect&#39; is an internationally accepted norm which allows foreign states to intervene in a state&#39;s internal affairs at times when the state fails to protect it’s people. Over the years there has been a constant debate whether the States have absolute authority over their affairs or whether the international community has the right to intervene in a country for humanitarian purposes. This committee aims to explore the morality and legality aspects of the human intervention around the globe and review of the R2P system.</p>
