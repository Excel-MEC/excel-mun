                <strong>Dear Leaders of Tomorrow,</strong>
                <p>
                The world is an interesting confluence of languages, cultures, perspectives and opinions. History  has witnessed the rise and fall of great nations and its people, the reign of progressive civilizations and the barbaric acts or despotic leaders. On the one hand, people all over the world continue to erect walls while on the other, technology has brought the world closer. In an age where alliances are fluid and extremism finds footing, it is upto the future leaders of the world to mould the course of mankind.

                <p>
                The Govt. Model Engineering College Model United Nations (MECMUN) aims to groom the leaders of tomorrow and equip them with the skill and knowledge to take over the reigns of the world, while at the same time maintaining professionalism and decorum mandated by society. MUN is the right platform for energetic and proficient delegates to speak out their ambitions for the future and empower them to take responsibility in building new mindsets from concealed perspectives. MECMUN aspires to elucidate the might of cooperation, the art of diplomacy and the need for artistry in substantial inquisition, oratory, debate and negotiation.
                </p>
